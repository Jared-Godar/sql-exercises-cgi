## Intro to SQL - Beginner Level

### SQL and Databases

- Structured Query Language
- Communicate with relational databases
- Stores large amounts of data well
- Scalable
- Metadata
- Secure

### DBMS

- Set of programs used to define, administer and process
- Oracle, Microsoft SQL
- MS Access
- MySQL
- FireBird
- IBM DB2

### DB Instances

- Complete database environment
- RDBMS software, table structure, stores procedures, other functions
- AKA, environment
- Production, test, and development instances

### Client / Server Overview

- Database on server, application on client machine
- Server reads, interprets, and executes SQL commands and communicates to client
- Client - hardware component and software component
- Client provides user interface

### SQL Client Tools

- SQLCMD
- SQL Management Studio SSMA

### SQL Server Management Studio

- Object explorer
- Qury Tabs
  
### Tables

- 2D data structure in rows and columns

### SQL COMMANDS

#### DDL - Data Definitaion Language

- `CREATE`
- `ALTER`
- `DROP`
- `RENAME`
- `TRUNCATE`
- `COMMENT`

#### DML - Data Manipulation Language

- `SELECT`
- `INSERT`
- `UPDATE`
- `DELETE`
- `MERGE`

#### DCL - Data Control Language

- Used by DB owners to allow or disallow specific permissions
- `GRANT`
- `REVOKE`

#### TCL - Transaction Control Language

- Save or undo changes to DML
- `COMMIT`
- `ROLLBACK`

### Things to know

1. Indentations: not dependent to execute, but lines and indents for readability important.
2. SQL Terminator - use `;` after every query
3. Not Case sensitive, but uppercase commands good style
4. Data dictionary and metadata: Information Schema

### SP COMMANDS / INFORMATION_SCHEMA

- `SP_COLUMNS` | Used to view structral info in Oracle DB
- `INFORMATION_SCHEMA`

## Query in SQL

### Basic Select

```sql
SELECT * FROM TABLE_NAME;
```

- Specific columns

```sql
SELECT col_name1 [, col_name2...]
    FROM TABLE_NAME;
```

- Distinct
- View distinct rows from a table

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT COL_NAME1
     FROM TABLE_NAME

SELECT DISTINCT CITY
     FROM ADDRESS;
```

- WHERE - select specific row

```sql
SELECT COL_NAME1
FROM TABLE_NAME
WHERE CONDITION;

SELECT * FROM ADDRESS
WHERE CITY = 'Seattle';
```

- Ensure filter conforms with datatype - '' for strings
- View Address, city, and postcode of addresses in seattle

```sql
SELECT AddressLine1, City, PostalCode
FROM ADDDRESSES
WHERE CITY = 'Seattle';
```

- Multiple conditions AND/OR

- All employees that are either female or marketing assistants

```sql
SELECT BusinessEntityID, JobTitle, MaritalStatus, Gender
FROM employee
WHERE 
```

## Operators and Functions

- Arithmetic `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`

```sql
SELECT MAX_SALARY-MIN_SALARY AS "SALARY_RANGE" FROM JOBS;
```

- Comparison `=`, `<`, `<=`, `>=`, `>`, `<>`, `!=`

```sql
SELECT * FROM PurchaseOrderDetail WHERE 
```

- Other `LIKE`, `NOT LIKE`, `BETWEEN`, `NOT BETWEEN`, `IN`, `NOT IN`

```sql
SELECT * FROM PurchaseOrderDetail WHERE LineTotal BETWEEN 20000 AND 30000;
```

## String Operations and Functions

- `+` Concatenate
- `LOWER()`
- `UPPER()`
- `LEN()`
- `LTRIM()` Left trim
- `RTRIM()`
- `SUBSTRING(strinname, start, end)`

## Aggregate

- `COUNT()`
- `COUNT(*)` Total rows
- `COUNT DISTINCT`
- `MAX()`
- `MIN()`
- `SUM()`
- `AVG()`

## More SQL

- `ORDER BY`
  - Specific order
  - Default ascending
  - `ORDER BY DESC`
  - `SELECT Col FROM Table WHERE cond ORDER BY col [, col2, ...]`
  - Can have next3ed, multiple order bys
- `GROUP BY`
  - Look at data in an aggregated way
  - `SELECT Col1, AGGREGATE_FN(col2) FROM table GROUP BY col1
  - `SELECT JobTitle, AVG(VacationHours) FROM Employee GROUP BY JobTitle;
- `INSERT`
  - `INSERT INTO tablename(colname) VALUES(value)`
  - `INSERT INTO Employees(JobTitle, BirthDate, MaritalStatus) VALUES ('Tool Designer', 1997-08-23, 'S)
  - Important to commit after inserting
- `UPDATE`
- `DELETE`
- `COMMIT`
  - Must always commit updates and deletes to save
  - Make tentative changes permate
- `ROLLBACK`
  - Unco DML commands
  - Tricky in SQL already inserted data cannot be rolled back easily, may require update / restoring

BEGIN TRANSACTION
// EXECUTE SQL CODE HERE
ROLLBACK TRANSACTION

## Data Definition Language (DDL)

- DDL syntax to change the way a database is physically designed
- Languate of structures
- `CREATE`
  - Create DB object. Focus on table createion
  - `CREATE TABLE table_name (col_name data type length, ...)`
  - CREATE TABLE TEST_TABLE()
  - Constraints - unique, primary key, foreign null, not null
    - CREATE TABLE test_table2(Test_table_2 IS INT PRIMARY KEY, NAME CHAR(20 NOT NULL, AGE INT);)

- `DROP`
  - Delete database object
  - `DROP TABLE TABLE_NAME;`
- `ALTER`
  - Alter structure of existing table
  - Add/Drop column
  - Change variable type
  - Rename table
  - `ALTER TABLE table_name ADD col_name column-definition;`
  - `ALTER TABLE suppliers ADD supplier_name Char(50);`
- `TRUNCATE`
  - Deletes all the dat in a table while retaining the table structure
  - `TRUNCATE TABLE TABLE_NAME;`
  - `TRUNCATE TABLE suppliers;
- `RENAME`

## DATA CONTROL LANGUAGE

- `GRANT`
  - Assign privilege to user or group
  - `GRANT privelige ON object TO `
  - `GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON COUNTRIES TO PUBLIC
- `REVOKE`
